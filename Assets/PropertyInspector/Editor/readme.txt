Property Inspector

	Property Inspector is a editor extension that allows you see and edit multiple objects at once. You can select as many object as you want - both from hierarchy or scene - and edit all of them toguether in one window.
	You can edit multiple objects that have the same type as if they were one, so that when you change a property, all selected objects of that type will be changed as well. This is true for any property at all.
	You can find any property in those objects by name. It doesn't matter if they are different, as long as they have a property that match the search, you can edit. You can also narrow your search using 'starts with', 'ends with', 'match' and path. When you use "starts with", all property whose name starts with the search will be shown; same for "ends with" and "match" whereas the property name must be a exact match. Note that these three options are NOT case sensitivy.
	When using paths, the property path must exactly match the path typed (case sensitivy). So, if you have a component that haves a property named "Player" and that player have a property named "Life", you can search for it using the path: "Player.Life" and only the life property inside the player will be shown. This is specially useful when dealing with lists where you can type "List.Array.data[x]" to edit only the X position inside that list.
