        I know you are new, but [D0FFB0FF]Alexis[-] trusted you so we trust you too. We don’t have much time, so i will be brief.
        We became aware of a [D0FFB0FF]Syndicate's[-] meeting being held today and we need your help. We just put in motion a plan to kill Michael, a key member of the Syndicate, and we need you to do the job.
        We manage to install a backdoor in the traffic control system. We want you to use this backdoor and provoque an accident to kill Michael.
        You need to [D0FFB0FF]connect[-] yourself to that backdoor using the instructions found on our FTP Server. Make sure that you will not be traced.
        I cannot - at least not yet - tell you why he must die, but i assure you that the answers will come soon.

        We are counting on you.

ps: Since you may not be too familiarized the situation, i've highlighted some useful names for you to search.
